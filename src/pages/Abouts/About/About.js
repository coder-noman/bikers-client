             <p className="text-center text-secondary">Bikers.com was founded in 2012 with the mission of helping Bikers organizations deliver a better customer experience at every step of the digital patient journey. Bikers.com practitioners today struggle to thrive in an increasingly digital and consumer-driven world, lacking expertise or effective solutions. And, as patients, the care-seeking experience is often frustrating and arduous. By introducing a “customer experience” mindset to organizations — one that is value-based, modern, and efficient — we can help evolve the Bikers.com industry.<br/><br/>

            We built our technology from the ground up to function as a holistic and robust customer experience platform — not another point solution. Today, we have the only offering in the industry that seamlessly integrates web-wide listings management, reputation insights, universal online scheduling, patient communications, provider data warehousing, and telemedicine.
